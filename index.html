          Mexico’s gasoline private-sector importers remain in Mexico, amid adverse political climate
        </h1>
        <p>
          International oil companies including ExxonMobil, Koch, Valero, BP and Chevron, among others continue to
          export gasoline into Mexico despite a highly adverse political climate favoring state-owned Pemex.
          Mexico’s energy policy, designed by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is based on strengthening the
          state-owned company, which has also meant increasing legal obstacles for non-Pemex companies to compete in the
          Mexican fuel market.
          Mexico does not publish the names of companies importing fuels. Yet shipping tracking software from analytics
          firm Vortexa showed the names of the main gasoline importers through detailed analysis and filtering.
          PMI, Pemex’s international trading arm, remains by far as the largest importer of fuel into Mexico with a
          total of 10.7mn bl (65,000 b/d) of gasoline imported through 15 June, since 1 January, according to the data.
          ExxonMobil lags in a far second, as it imported roughly a tenth of what PMI imported with 1.5mn bl (9,30 b/d)
          in the same period.

          While most of the imports come from the US Gulf coast, Vortexa also gave detail on the origin and destiny of
          the shipments.
          The origin of the tankers varies widely a gasoline to Mexico comes from ports as north as New York, or
          Washington state in the US northwest coast.

        <p> The most common route was Beaumont, Texas to Tuxpan port in Veracruz, with 37 ships in the same during the first half of this year. Tuxpan was indeed the port that received more gasoline followed by Veracruz, Rosarito and Coatzacoalcas.
          The ports that exported the most were Beaumont, Port Arthur, Houston, and Lake Charles, according to Vortexa data.
