# Mexicoâ€™s gasoline private-sector importers remain in Mexico, amid adverse political climate
Analysis of the main companies importing fuel into Mexico from the US

The page used an intense analysis of Vortexa database to name an unreported group of companies that continue to import gasoline to Mexico.
Analysis was done throught a download of a data-frame from Vortexa of all vessel deliveries from 1 January through 15 June. 

In the VS code you can see several filterings, groupby's, and value_counts that finally gave accurate answers to the main questions of the project.

Visually the page fails to transmit accurately the work it was done, as we had several issues with ai2html, despite several tries.

We also struggled wit hth ecreation of the arc map, yet it faithfully reflects the most common routes, and gives an image of the routes used by tankers to deliver gasoline to Mexico form the US.
